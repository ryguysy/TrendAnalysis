0,"I understand that a big earnings miss,will weaken a,stock's momentum.. Mathematically that is obvious

 BUT what i am asking is if NVDA/TSLA/LLY/Planatir/etc. have big earnings,miss, can the stock price shake it off and continue an incredible bullish run.. Or is,that generally the end of the extraordinary stock run?

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w​as there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

Something I've wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject?

Right i am wondering this,about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock

I do know AAPL didn't have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so

Thanks in adance.. I am very interested in stock theory, backteating and research papers (academic or practitioner)

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",0,2,2025-01-21,0.9994

Two years ago,  I started working for a US company and my income drastically increased. Last year, I started buying ETFs. I invested a total amount of $ 35,000 mainly in the US (VOO, VYM), but also in Europe (EUDG), and India (FLIN).

The goal is to buy ETFs and let them sit until my retirement in 28 years. I pay into the German retirement fund every month and I will eventually go back to Germany at some point, but want to have shares to boost my retirement income.

6,"**Key Points**

* Tariff proposals have put the complex global supply chain front and center as President-elect Donald Trump gets inaugurated on Monday.
* On the campaign trail, Trump said he would add tariffs for goods made in other countries, especially China.
* Those higher costs on sneakers, cars, furniture and more could force many consumers to change their buying habits.

**Tickers mentioned in this article: MAT, ELF, STLA, GM, F, TGT,  KTB, TAP, STZ, GOOS, LAMB**

>Many of the items that U.S. shoppers browse and buy in retailers’ aisles come from far-away factories or farms — a reality that could soon force many consumers to change their buying habits.

>Sneakers, T-shirts, beer and other common household items are often made in countries like China, Mexico and Canada before they wind their way to a big-box retailer, grocer or mall in the U.S. That complex global supply chain is front and center Monday as President-elect Donald Trump gets inaugurated and is widely expected to announce new tariffs on imports.

>While tariffs have become a familiar concept for more Americans since Trump implemented them on metals and other key materials during his first term in office, the levies he has threatened for his return to the White House could have a much bigger effect on household budgets.

>Most people have little grasp of just how many items could see price hikes due to the duties: from avocados to children’s toys, to chocolate and cars, experts told CNBC. Proposed tariffs on products from China, Mexico and Canada — the three largest U.S. trading partners — would likely affect U.S. consumers the most.

>The exact details of those tariffs, including which countries would be affected and how high the duties might be, remain unclear and could change. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke about implementing 10% to 20% tariffs on all countries, and putting levies as high as 60% on Chinese goods.

>While news reports in recent weeks have suggested Trump could scale back his tariff proposals, and could be using them as a negotiating tactic to bend foreign governments to his will, the president-elect has denied those reports.

>Since his first run for president, Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more manufacturing in the U.S. and promote job creation and national security. It’s not just him: President Joe Biden and other Democrats have backed more limited tariffs for the same reasons.

>Regardless, the risk is clear for retailers: Any tariffs would bring extra costs they’d have to absorb, share with producers or pass on to customers by charging higher prices *—* the latter of which is the most likely scenario as the industry is reluctant to sacrifice profits, retail executives and industry experts told CNBC in recent weeks. Major retail trade groups, including the National Retail Federation and Consumer Technology Association, have warned tariffs would effectively become a tax on American businesses and consumers.

>Shoppers are already expecting tariffs to hit their pocketbooks. About 67% U.S. adults surveyed said they think it is very likely or somewhat likely that companies will pass on the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to Morning Consult survey of more than 4,400 people in early December. Even so, the same poll found about 45% of adults back a 10% tariff on all imports, and more than a third of respondents support a 20% duty on all goods and a 60% levy on Chinese imports.

>Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader for PwC, said tariffs have become the number one topic of discussion among companies working with the consulting firm, and the conversations have reached the top of the C-suite. She said the tariff fallout could be different now than during Trump’s first term, since his new proposal is broader and comes as retailers struggle to convince inflation-weary consumers to spend.

>“It’s not 2017,” she said. “Because there’s a more cost-conscious consumer, you have to be much more thoughtful about passing on those costs to the consumer.”

>“At the same time, you don’t want to come across as anti-tariff or anti-American,” she added.

>Planning for tariffs now is challenging because companies do not know how Trump will proceed. Automotive executives who have spoken with CNBC in recent weeks said they are preparing for several different scenarios but not making any moves until there’s more clarity.

>“We are working, obviously, on scenarios,” Antonio Filosa, head of Stellantis’ North American operations, said. “But yes, we need to await his decisions and after the decision of Mr. Trump and his administration, we will work accordingly.”

>Professor Brett House, an economist from Columbia Business School, said just about every consumer product could see a price increase under the proposals, but some companies have higher exposure than others\*\*.\*\*

>“Something around 50% of U.S. petroleum imports come from Canada. The Trump administration puts tariffs on those, it is unequivocally the case that everything in the United States will become substantially more expensive,” House told CNBC in an interview. “The breadth of the impact that we should expect to see from these tariffs could be enormous and could affect every single thing we produce in the United States and every household and every business. No one will be immune.”

>Here are just some of the everyday items that would be affected if duties on goods from China, Canada and Mexico take effect.

>**China: Sneakers, furniture and toys**

>Within closets, living rooms and children’s playrooms, a range of American household goods originate in China.

>The country is the largest furniture exporter on the globe, according to data from the Home Furnishings Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of home goods retailers. In 2023, $32.4 billion in furniture was imported into the U.S., 29% of which came from China, followed close behind by Vietnam, which accounted for 26.5% of imports, according to the HFA, which cited investment banking firm Mann, Armistead & Epperson – one of the furniture industry’s top sources for data. Between 30% and 40% of furniture is produced in the U.S., but as much as 50% of raw materials – like wood, fabrics, hinges and screws – are imported, making price increases on home products difficult to avoid, even if they’re technically “made in America.”

>HFA CEO Shannon Williams said home goods retailers cannot withstand a 60% tariff on China imports and would likely have to move supply chains if Trump’s proposed tariffs went into effect. While tables and couches likely would not cost 60% more, their prices would still rise, said Williams.

>If companies redirected supply chains to Vietnam, where many manufacturers fled during Trump’s first administration, retailers could still face tariffs of 10% to 20% – plus the cost of moving and scaling operations. The tariffs alone could make a $2,000 couch cost as much as $2,200 to $2,400.

>If businesses moved operations to Mexico, which accounted for about 10% of U.S. furniture imports in 2023, a $2,000 couch could cost up to 25% more at $2,500.

>When Trump first announced tariff increases, some industry experts suggested that retailers might eat some of that cost and try to pass some on to the manufacturer to prevent big price hikes for consumers.

>Between 2018 and 2019, when Trump introduced 10% tariffs on certain goods during his first administration, furniture prices increased by about 2.3%, according to the HFA, which cited data from the consumer price index.

>This time around, the tariffs are not only higher, but also the home goods sector is struggling, leaving it less equipped to absorb the cost. Covid-era purchasing, high interest rates and a sluggish housing market have made it a “rough couple years” for the industry, said Williams.

>Beyond furniture, consumers could see another everyday item cost more if higher tariffs take effect: toys.

>Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, and the cost of toys made outside of the U.S. could increase by up to 56% under Trump’s proposals, according to the Toy Association, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of the industry.

>That would make a $20 Barbie doll, which has historically been manufactured in China, cost as much as $31.20.

>“If this were to happen, parents could be pushed to buy less expensive, non-compliant toys from unsanctioned, online sellers. These toys often do not meet U.S. safety and quality standards and could be toxic and dangerous to children, putting them at risk,” the Toy Association said in an email to CNBC. “Toys produced by the U.S. toy industry are compliant with rigorous safety and quality standards, and we hope they will remain affordable to American families and not subject to tariffs.” As of the end of 2023, about 50% of toys from Barbie’s parent company Mattel were made in China, according to CEO Ynon Kreiz. This year, Mattel expects less than 40% of its sourcing to come from China so its “exposure in the U.S. to China sourcing is therefore 20%” given the company’s geographic sales mix, Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro said.

>“We’ve done a good job mitigating the potential exposure,” DiSilvestro said during a Morgan Stanley retail conference in December. “But to the extent we’re impacted, we would expect to raise prices to offset it.”

>Footwear is another industry with a heavy reliance on China. About 37% of footwear imports came from the country in 2023, followed by about 30% from Vietnam, nearly 9% from Italy and 8% from Indonesia, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission

>Nearly 100% of all footwear is imported to the U.S., according to the group.

>Even before Trump’s first term, footwear manufacturers were moving some sourcing out of China as its labor force shrank, the organization’s CEO Matt Priest said. Yet he said it would be unrealistic to return production to the U.S., and moving it to another part of Asia can be difficult.

>Already, some companies have accelerated their plans. Steve Madden said in November that it will reduce the goods it imports from China by as much as 45% over the next year.

>At a press conference on Thursday, Priest said U.S. footwear companies are waiting for clearer policy.

>“All of these actions are inflationary,” he said. “You have to pay the piper somewhere.”

>China isn’t a major manufacturer of cosmetics, but E.l.f. Beauty , a drugstore staple and popular brand among younger shoppers, makes about 80% of its makeup in the region.

>During an interview with CNBC late last year, CEO Tarang Amin said the company could be forced to raise prices if the tariff hikes take effect — a risky move considering its low prices are one of its main draws.

>**Mexico: Cars, beer and avocados**

>Over the last decade, U.S. consumers have developed a bigger appetite for avocados and Mexican beers. They’ve also gotten used to buying cars from major U.S. automakers with a lot of manufacturing in Mexico.

>Tariffs on Mexican imports could endanger those habits, particularly for price-sensitive shoppers.

>Most major automakers have factories in the U.S. However, they still heavily rely on imports from other countries including Mexico to meet American consumer demand.

>Under the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that replaced it, automakers increasingly looked to Mexico as a less expensive place to produce vehicles than in the U.S. or Canada.

>Nearly every major automaker operating in the U.S. has at least one plant in Mexico, including the top six-selling automakers that accounted for more than 70% of U.S. sales in 2024.

>The industry is deeply integrated between the countries, with Mexico importing 49.4% of all auto parts from the U.S. In turn, Mexico exports 86.9% of its auto parts production to the U.S., according to the International Trade Administration.

>Wells Fargo estimates that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada imports would put most of the adjusted earnings of General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis at risk. The firm estimates the impact of 5%, 10% and 25% tariffs to be $13 billion, $25 billion and $56 billion, respectively, across the three companies.

>Most notably, GM and Stellantis both have massive plants in Mexico that produce highly profitable full-size pickup trucks. They, along with Ford and others, also have built EVs in Mexico to lower costs.

>Mexico is also home to the top-selling beer in the U.S. In 2023, Constellation Brands’ Modelo overtook the crown from Bud Light. Constellation also owns Corona, which ranks in the top 10 U.S. beer brands, and fast-growing Pacifico.

>All of the company’s beer brands are imported from Mexico, and beer accounted for 85% of the company’s sales in the first three quarters of its fiscal year.

>If Trump implements the tariffs, Constellation’s cost of goods sold would rise by roughly 16%, according to estimates from Wells Fargo Securities.

>The company would likely choose to offset the levies by raising prices, because moving production doesn’t seem like an option due to a 2013 antitrust settlement. Constellation has spent billions of dollars in recent years to expand its Mexican production capacity.

>On the company’s latest earnings conference call, Constellation CEO Bill Newlands said “it’s really too early to hypothesize” about how the tariffs will play out.

>“As you would expect, we have a lot of permutations that we have considered and certainly we’ll adjust our approach depending on what plays out as we go forward,” he told analysts on Jan. 10.

>Uncertainty about tariffs has led a number of Wall Street analysts to downgrade Constellation’s stock since Trump announced his intention to reignite a trade war with Mexico.

>Avocados have proven less easy to substitute than beers.

>The fruit, once a rare sight in U.S. grocery stores, has become a staple of produce displays, thanks to the growing popularity of Mexican food and diets that call for “healthy fats.”

>From June 2023 to June 2024, the U.S. imported more than 2.4 billion pounds of Mexican Hass avocados.

>In the U.S., avocados are grown in California, Florida and Hawaii. But roughly 90% of the avocados eaten in the U.S. are grown in Mexico, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

>The country is one of the few places that can produce the fruit year round, ensuring that consumers can eat avocado toast in the summer and guacamole on Super Bowl Sunday.

>Over the years, avocado consumers have proven that they are willing to pay more for the fruit. While avocado demand has roughly doubled over the last decade, prices have also climbed.

>“There’s nothing like an avocado ... There are times of the year that yes, our prices go a little bit higher, but I feel like that is also part of the norm with our consumers. We don’t see a great dip in our consumption when those prices are a little bit higher,” Alvaro Luque, CEO of the nonprofit Avocados from Mexico, told CNBC.

>Chipotle Mexican Grill famously charges a premium for adding guacamole, but the chain’s customers have largely shrugged off price increases across its menu over the last few years. The burrito chain is one of the few restaurant companies that reported traffic growth quarter after quarter last year.

>Outside of avocados and cars, some companies make clothing in Mexico, too. Kontoor Brands , for example, has turned to the region to make some of its Wrangler jeans. While some of its denim currently retails for about $60 at Macy’s, that could rise to as much as $75 with tariffs factored in.

>**Canada: Cars, coats and French fries Tariffs on Canadian goods would be another blow for automakers and car buyers. French fries and winter coats also risk getting pricier for consumers.**

>Canada exported $27 billion of cars in 2022, trailing only crude petroleum as its top export, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

>Tariffs on Canadian vehicles would impact Detroit automakers the most, but there would likely be consequences across the industry depending on changes to parts from suppliers such as Canada-based Magna. Ontario Premier Doug Ford and other politicians and industry officials have described Trump’s tariff proposal as an existential threat to the country’s recovering automotive industry.

>Five automakers — Ford, GM, Stellantis, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor — produced 1.54 million light-duty vehicles last year in the province, largely for U.S. consumers.

>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned on Wednesday that potential 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada would harm the U.S. auto sector, increase vehicle prices and benefit China.

>“Think about this: 70% of all the auto parts we make in Michigan go directly to our neighbors. ... The only winner in that equation is China. They would love nothing more than to watch us cripple American’s auto ecosystem all by ourselves. This is a matter of national security. We cannot let that happen,” she said during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show.

>But it wouldn’t just be the auto industry that feels the pressure from Canadian tariffs.

>Consider the humble French fry: Canada exports roughly $40.5 billion in agricultural goods to the U.S. annually, including $1.7 billion in frozen French fries and other frozen potato products, according to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the country’s counterpart to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

>Canada’s frozen French fries largely come from McCain Foods. The Canadian family-owned company says that one out of every four fries eaten globally comes from its facilities. The company has seven Canadian factories and 11 in the U.S, according to its subsidiaries’ websites.

>As the last year has shown, consumers have grown more price sensitive at grocery stores and in fast-food drive-thru lanes, making it unlikely that they’d swallow a price increase offsetting the tariff.

>If Trump does implement steeper tariffs on Canadian goods, McCain could shift even more of its production to the U.S. Suppliers could jump ship to a U.S. rival like Lamb Weston. Luckily, many French fry suppliers, including the Idaho-based Lamb Weston, have expanded their capacity since the Covid pandemic.

>**Tariffs on Canadian goods could also affect apparel.**

>Canada Goose has built its reputation on high-end outerwear for chilly temperatures, made in Canada. About 70% of the retailer’s merchandise is made in the country, and 30% is made in Europe at a factory that the company owns in Romania and at contractors in other parts of the continent.

>A company spokesperson declined to comment on how Canada Goose is preparing for tariffs and whether it will increase prices.

I need it for a research project. 
After giving up on trying to directly find a list of its constituents, I've been puzzling it together from the subindices, adding them to the S&P500. But I can't find lists for the TOPIX 150 and S&P Europe 350.

I've already looked on S&P Global's website and contacted their customer service. They only list the biggest companies on their website and only provide the full lists to institutional clients on a subscription basis. 
Finding lists for the S&P 500, ASX, Asia, Latin America and TSX indices wasn't too hard but for the TOPIX 150 and S&P Europe 350, I've invested hours of late night schizo research and asked our AI overlords, to no avail.

8,">The woes of speaker maker Sonos have raised the prospect of a takeover, but who might want to buy it? 

>

>For months, Sonos Inc. has been reeling. After a disastrous software rollout last year, the audio technology company that some used to call “the Apple of speakers” remains mired in the biggest crisis in its two-decade history.

>

>It all started in May when the company introduced a revamped app — the software that lets customers control their speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, headphones and other devices. The app was designed to modernize the Sonos experience and lay the groundwork for new types of products, such as the Ace headphones. But it lacked vital features and was hobbled by bugs, turning the simple act of using Sonos equipment into a nightmare.

>

>The missing features — including the sleep timer, advanced music queues, alarms, and functions related to searching and navigating music libraries — have mostly been restored. But users have reported that glitches persist in some cases: Devices don’t pair, audio volume will spike without warning, connections fail, and streaming doesn’t always go smoothly.

>

>Sonos should have never launched the new app the way it did and was aware of many bugs prior to the initial release. It should have kept around the old and reliable S2 app and launched the new version as a beta test. Once the revamped software became as dependable as the old app, Sonos could have moved forward with the new version as the default. Of course, that would have provided less of a splashy marketing opportunity — the chance to flip the switch on a whole new experience.

>

>So here we are. The new app ended up being devastating to employee morale, company revenue and the brand’s reputation. It’s a disaster on par with Apple’s rocky move to its own Maps software from Google in 2012 — a switch that led to the ouster of the company’s software chief. The big difference is that, for Apple, Maps is one app. For Sonos, the change compromised the software underpinning all its products.

>

>Sonos’ board ultimately needed to take action. More than six months after the launch of the app — and even after an apology tour from its executives and a multitude of attempted fixes — the company parted ways with Chief Executive Officer Patrick Spence a week ago. The next day, it also cut loose its chief product officer, who many Sonos employees blamed for the app mess.

>

>In their place is interim CEO Tom Conrad, a co-creator of music streaming service Pandora and former executive at Snap Inc. He has served on the Sonos board since 2017 and was already helping with the app recovery effort. Though the company has vowed to search the globe for a new full-time CEO, many Sonos staffers believe Conrad has the inside track to get the job — if he wants it.

>

>But with Sonos’ market valuation hovering around $1.7 billion — down from more than $5 billion during a pandemic-fueled rally — the board will probably consider whether selling the company makes more sense.

>

>Apple has long been seen as a potential suitor, given the two companies’ similarities. Sonos is focused on premium design with a tightly controlled ecosystem — just like Apple. They share a penchant for audio technology, and their corporate cultures have some overlap.

>

>Apple could snap up Sonos for $2 billion or so — less than it paid for Beats — and it would only cost them a few days’ worth of revenue. Sonos’ hardware could also shore up Apple’s disappointing HomePod and home audio lineup.

>

>But I don’t believe Apple will ever acquire Sonos. If Apple really wanted to build out its home audio business, it already has the hardware, software, content and manufacturing chops internally. It’s just about wanting to get things done properly — something that Apple is already working on. Later this year, it will launch its own home hub and a new HomePod mini.

>

>The only things it would gain from Sonos are a user base, a collection of patents and the employees — none of which Apple needs. Sonos’ software is obviously something Apple wouldn’t want, especially in its current state, and audio hardware has become heavily commoditized.

>

>Other potential suitors, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., wouldn’t make much sense either. Meta has all but exited the smart home, choosing to focus on AI and wearables instead. Google has a painful history with Sonos involving patent lawsuits. And Microsoft has increasingly scaled back its interest in non-Xbox hardware in recent years.

>

>Still, there are some major technology companies that might consider the idea. That list includes [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Roku Inc. and Spotify Technology SA.

>

>Amazon seems like the most natural fit. With former Microsoft Chief Product Officer Panos Panay now leading its hardware efforts, the expectation is that Amazon will revamp its device lineup and shift toward more upscale offerings. Sonos’ speakers already work with the entire streaming music industry and are certainly high-end.

>

>Sonos’ premium technology could be the basis for a series of new Amazon Echo devices running the upcoming AI-infused Alexa digital assistant. It would also help Amazon expand into new areas, such as over-ear headphones and soundbars — two categories the company has explored in the past.

>

>Amazon could certainly afford to buy Sonos, though it would have to overcome regulatory hurdles. Don’t forget: Amazon had to back out of a deal to buy Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after the European Union threatened to block the acquisition.

>

>A European company like Spotify might have an easier time getting a deal cleared. The streaming music service has championed the idea of hardware products that can run services from several different players, which Sonos does well. Spotify has long wanted to get into hardware but struggled to make it happen. Sonos would give them an instant entry, with an excellent range of products that could run its audio services.

>

>Roku is another possibility, though it would probably face antitrust concerns. After all, the company already sells a set of low-end soundbars and TV speakers. If it could make a deal work, Roku would get higher-end products that can potentially command higher profit margins. One caveat: This may need to be a stock-based deal given Roku doesn’t have as much cash on hand as its bigger rivals.

>

>Samsung is a wild card. The company already sells soundbars and subwoofers and even acquired the Harman brand in 2017. But it’s failed to crack the home speaker space. It announced an Echo-like speaker called the Galaxy Home several years ago but never actually brought it to market. Sonos would help it create a more consumer-focused line of home audio gear and provide more modern technology for its home theater products.

>

>For consumers, the best scenario is probably Sonos figuring things out and remaining independent — the current goal of the company. With the world’s biggest tech giants expanding into every facet of our lives, there is something appealing about an independent brand that plays nice with all the platforms. It’s just unclear how long Sonos will be able to do it alone.

>

>Retail inventory of the current iPhone SE quickly shrinks ahead of new model’s debut. One of Apple’s most significant new products this year will be the the iPhone SE’s replacement. The device — codenamed V59 — will mark the beginning of Apple’s transition from Qualcomm Inc. cellular modem chips to silicon designed in-house. It also means the company will no longer sell an iPhone with the now-antiquated home button. The latest model, which will also add Apple Intelligence, is set to launch by the spring — and there are signs Apple is gearing up for the release.

>

>According to people working in Apple’s retail operations, a surprisingly large number of US stores have little to no inventory of the iPhone SE remaining. Consumers can still get the device from the online store — and it ships out within a few days — but finding one at a brick-and-mortar outlet is going to be harder and harder. Apple also has ceased sales of the current SE in the European Union because the device lacks the now-required USB-C port.

>

>The drawing down of inventory is a reliable sign that a new model is coming. But it also suggests that Apple probably won’t keep the current version around — at a reduced price — after the update is here. That seems like a missed opportunity, since a cheap iPhone could’ve helped Apple make inroads in some markets. The current SE costs $429, and the new one might be more than that given its enhanced features.

>

>This new iPhone isn’t the only big product update on the horizon. As I wrote last week, look out for upcoming MacBook Airs with the M4 “Donan” chip, as well as fresh low-end iPads, iPad Airs and new Magic Keyboards in the not-too-distant future.

>

>Apple is bringing AI to Mac Mail app in macOS 15.4, even as it scales back notification summaries in iOS 18.3. The Apple Intelligence rollout is continuing with the release of macOS 15.3 in a few weeks. For the first time, Apple is bringing its Genmoji custom emoji to the Mac — following their debut on the iPhone and iPad. The company will add more features by April with iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4. The big addition at that time will be the new Siri digital assistant, which will be able to better tap into personal information and use the App Intents technology to more precisely control apps.

>

>But there’s another, more under-the-radar feature coming in April as well: The Mac will get the upgraded Mail app that uses AI to prioritize messages and sort content into different inboxes. Right now, iPad and iPhone users are able to tap into the feature — which is terrific — but Mac customers have been left behind. That changes with macOS 15.4, I’m told. For those not familiar with the feature: It sorts mail into a primary category, as well as ones for transactions, promotions, updates and all mail.

>

>In other Apple Intelligence news, the company is scaling back notification summaries in iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3. For months, news organizations and users have been complaining about incorrect or misleading notifications from Apple Intelligence. Rather than quickly fixing its AI models, Apple is simply pulling the plug on summaries from news and entertainment apps. You can also more easily disable summaries from the lock screen, and recaps are now italicized.

>

>Apple’s ex-chief people officer lands at HP. It’s not easy to join Apple after a career outside the company. The place is run by big personalities like Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, Greg Joswiak and others who have been there for several decades. In other words, if you’re walking into Apple thinking you’re going to change how it operates, you’re in for a surprise.

>

>That was the case with Carol Surface, who joined Apple in 2023 as chief people officer after working at Medtronic Plc, Best Buy Co. and PepsiCo Inc. She flamed out after less than two years. Stella Low, Apple’s short-lived vice president of communications, ran into similar issues in 2022.

>

>Both women were hired by Cook himself and stayed at Apple for way less time than anticipated, but now they have another thing in common: They landed at HP Inc. afterward. Low joined the computer maker as its chief communications officer in 2022 and recently left. Surface just agreed to join HP and is starting March 24. Given Surface’s successful and varied human resources career prior to Apple, she could end up being a good fit for HP.

>

>Speaking of Apple’s insidery culture: It was no surprise that Surface’s role was ultimately filled by Deirdre O’Brien, her predecessor and a 30-plus-year veteran of the company. Low, meanwhile, was replaced by Kristin Huguet, a member of Apple’s PR department since before the original iPhone went on sale.

>

>They’re both capable leaders, but Apple will eventually need to figure out how to bring in more talent from the outside. Right now, the company isn’t always built to handle fresh ideas from newcomers. With Apple’s need to innovate and find new sources of revenue, that might be a problem in the not-too-distant future.

>

**The Schedule**

>Jan. 22 — Samsung unveils Galaxy S25 line. Samsung is set to announce its Galaxy S25 smartphone lineup at its Unpacked event this week in San Jose, California. This year’s devices aren’t expected to get a major hardware overhaul, with the company instead focusing more on software and artificial intelligence features. But Samsung aims to show that it has an edge over Apple in this area. Stay tuned for coverage of Unpacked this week, including all of the details of the new devices. And if you’re waiting for news on Samsung smartwatches and foldable phones, those will likely debut later in the year.

>

>Jan. 30 — Apple’s first-quarter results. The earnings report — the first under Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh — will give details of Apple’s all-important holiday season. Investors will get an idea of how the iPhone 16 is selling, as well as updated AirPods and Apple Watches. The company also should provide the first real sense of whether the Apple Intelligence AI platform is spurring consumers to upgrade their devices. Wall Street is looking for about $124 billion in revenue during the period, a 4% gain from a year earlier.

>

>**Post Game Q&A**

>Q: Why is Tim Cook attending the Trump inauguration?

>A: Many Apple employees are none too pleased that their CEO is heading to Washington to kiss the ring and attend Trump’s swearing-in event on Monday. (Cook also personally donated $1 million to the inauguration fund.) The move seems to clash with Apple’s support of diversity, immigration and other progressive causes — ones that Cook himself has championed. But it’s equally clear that Apple may need Trump’s help over the next four years as it contends with tariffs, the Justice Department antitrust case and mounting pressure from the European Union. Cook likely believes Trump can alleviate these problems. He’s also not alone in turning out for the president-elect. Most of the world’s most valuable tech companies are sending a high-profile leader to the event.

>

>Q: When are the new Powerbeats Pro 2 launching?

>A: The latest earbuds from Apple’s Beats subsidiary are due imminently. The new accessory has already been submitted to the Federal Communications Commission and other regulators for approval, and the company is gearing up for a press briefing in a week or so to go over the details of the new product. The upgrades will feature a smaller overall design and improvements like Spatial Audio and enhanced noise cancellation that are already available on AirPods. The programming code within iOS also suggests that these earbuds could be capable of collecting heart-rate data from a wearer. I’ve previously reported that Apple is working on this technology and actively testing it.

>

>Q: Why is Apple starting to use US-made chips?

>A: A major, under-discussed risk facing Apple right now is that practically 100% of its advanced processors are made in Taiwan by partner TSMC. If Taiwan goes down for whatever reason (a political crisis, natural disaster or something else), Apple is in big trouble with no real plan B. That’s why moving more production to other areas is so critical, and such a shift is now underway. TSMC is running test production of lower-end Apple chips at a facility in Arizona, the first step toward more ambitious goals. Over time, Apple hopes to get chips from other factories in the US and elsewhere, including Europe. Let’s face it, the company has been fairly lucky so far that its chip production hasn’t suffered major hiccups. Apple’s reliance on one geographic location for the most important component in its devices has been a major hazard for years.

9,"It seems like a significant number of TikTok users are growing frustrated with platforms like Facebook and Messenger, with many potentially rage-quitting or deleting these apps altogether. Considering TikTok’s massive user base—about 1 billion globally and 170 million in the U.S.—even a fraction of this shift could create a noticeable impact on Meta.

The question is, how might this trend affect Meta’s stock? On one hand, Meta has faced declines before and adapted through diversification and innovations like Instagram Reels. On the other, losing younger users—key to ad revenue—could hurt them long-term, especially with TikTok growing as a major competitor.

While Meta’s resources and global reach may help cushion the blow, the perception of a mass exodus could still shake investor confidence. Is this a temporary issue Meta can counter, or could it signal a deeper shift in the social media landscape? What do you think?",0,34,2025-01-19,0.8966

And I have myself a question - should I just diversify on my own depending on market sentiments and still hold these forever, or there’s some other logic why these ETFs beat my logic with concentration of only 3-5 main stocks?

11,"I posted a similar Topic in a couple of other subs yesterday but Mods were quickly removing them  on the basis that the question was too "" subjective "" 

  
Anyway I've been working on a theory for a few years now that the markets have very very little to do with actual company performance or metrics and everything to do about Mass perception and psychology 

  
Almost every day now I see a trader trying to analyse a stock based on a Shiller ratio or a Buffet Indicator or pattern whatever ...

  
Are we really going to kid ourselves the markets are trading on these metrics anymore !?! if so how do we explain Big Tech ? most of the valuations defy every piece of logical or rational explanation

  
A share price can move more on 4 lines of text from an individual on a social media site than on a full quarters earnings report 

  
Then allow me to move into day trading which is perhaps the most manipulated aspect of the entire show , we've known since the dawn of time Tutes and Hedges have the upper hand but now I believe with A.I trading algorithms thats been taken to a level whereby there's literal fraud happening on a daily basis

If you think this is crazy conspiracy level stuff try researching algorithmic and cryptographic trading signals

These theories and technology's speculate that these trading Algos can now actually communicate between each other via a certain price signal and then work together to shift the market higher or lower 

You can't beat this , yea you can get lucky and maybe be on the right side of the coin when it happens but generally over a sustained period these are cleverly programmed to bleed day traders out and to often go against Mass assumption 

This explains the very odd situation whereby sometimes a company gets bad news the stock actually ends up trading higher and vice versa. This is a strange Phenomenon most traders can never explain or comprehend so its often passed of as "" oh markets just being irrational"" 

No that's a lie its being done intentionally to Fvck the opposite positions 

Tesla is a fantastic example of everything I've talked about above really the daily and weekly price movement needs to investigated by the SEC for securities fraud ( it won't) but I believe a deep forensic analysis would uncover a body of manipulation and fraud 

Long term we all know the overall stock market will keep going higher and higher forever which I guess means locking capital in for 40 years into ETF's  makes the most sense , but again the big boys know dam well Retail gets impatient and wants faster gain and will try to make daily / weekly or monthly trades

( more market phsychology ) 

  
Theres a lot of FOMO out there now too which further exacerbates many traders need to get in on the action 

  
This is exactly what Tutes/ Hedges and Banks want ......it's their bread and butter 

Anyway looking forward to hearing others opinions , I'm not particularly interested in discussing if this is a conspiracy or not because frankly its brutally obvious a lot of this is happening in some context and you would be very very Naive to think otherwise 

 But maybe I have some angles or aspects wrong or maybe I've missed something somebody else wants to add

17,"Here's my Investment breakdown on Yeti's future and the key points applicable. Let me know what you all think

**Macro Overview:**

* **Macroeconomic Challenges and Tariff Risks:** There is much uncertainty about potential tariff increases on Chinese manufacturing goods. Yeti relies on Chinese production, which could impact profit margins if increased tariffs become a reality. This situation may require Yeti to enact price increases for consumers In response, to offset costs. Yeti is actively diversifying its supply chain, aiming to reduce its dependence on China.
* **Competitive Landscape** Yeti operates in a fiercely competitive market. Major competitors include brands like Stanley, Hydro Flask, RTIC Outdoors, S'Well and CamelBak. Macroeconomic conditions could intensify competition as consumers seek value-oriented options with pricing being of the utmost importance. If tariff threats become reality, costs will increase for consumers. This change will instantly impact how consumers are willing to spend.
* **Economic Downturn and Consumer Spending:** Yeti is heavily dependent on discretionary consumer spending. Economic slowdowns or recessions would reduce demand for its high-end products, like coolers and drinkware. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates in 2025 may continue to squeeze disposable income.

**Thesis:**

* **Strategic Acquisitions:** Yeti acquired two separate companies in 2024. Mystery Ranch is one of them. It designs and manufactures durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories. The acquisition was valued at approximately $36.2 million funded via cash on hand. The second company is Butter Pat Industries, a company that specializes in premium cast iron cookware. This acquisition cost approximately $48.5 million aimed to enhance Yeti’s capabilities in the cookware category. Both acquisitions helped to fuel ambitious new categories in which Yeti released new products or further enhancements in. Yeti has shown they are willing to spend cash on hand for extra growth. They can choose to do so again in the future with a large cash position over $280 million.
* **Strong Balance Sheet and Financial Health:** Yeti’s balance sheet remains strong. There is a 10% increase in assets and a decrease in long-term debt. The company maintains a high cash-to-debt ratio of 3.55. The company’s low debt load, coupled with a significant cash reserve, supports strategic opportunities. These include acquisitions and share buybacks. This financial strategy reinforces Yeti’s stable financial position. It enhances the company’s ability to weather economic uncertainties.
* **DTC & Retail Growth**: Yeti has experienced significant growth in its direct-to-consumer approach. In all three quarters of 2024 Yeti has seen growth with 8.2% in Q3 alone. This expansion allows Yeti to shift strategic focus on building direct relationships with customers. It reduces reliance on third-party retailers and increases profit margins in the process. To complement this growth, Yeti is expanding their retail presence with flagship retail locations. These locations serve as experiential hubs where customers can engage with the brand.
* **International Expansion**: International growth of over 30% indicates significant growth opportunities for the future. While it is still a small part of total sales, this growth is in many ways still in its infancy. As expansion and brand awareness continue, the international market can return a much larger share of total sales. Yeti’s investments overseas have been highly rewarding. The company has seen four consecutive quarters of over 30% growth. This indicates successful market penetration and diversification

**Conclusion:**

* The tariff concerns whether overblown or not are a real concern. Fierce competition from rivals continues to play an important factor in the battle for who has the most popular product. Yeti boasts an attractive valuation with their P/E significantly below their 5-year average from 36.6 to now 16.09 and a strong balance sheet. The company shows encouraging growth with enticing international expansion. This makes Yeti worth keeping an eye on at the least. Despite this, the stock has been largely flat for a year while earnings continue to outperform analyst projections. With new product offerings, Yeti showcases their strong brand reputation for premium products and further growth.

23,"Microsoft is adding artificial intelligence tools to its consumer Microsoft 365 bundle and bumping up the price for the first time since introducing subscriptions 12 years ago.

In a blog post Thursday, Microsoft said it’s bringing its Copilot AI assistant into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote applications for consumers who have the Microsoft 365 suite.

The increase of $3 per month is meant “to reflect the extensive subscription benefits that we’ve added over the past 12 years and enable us to deliver new innovations for years to come,” Bryan Rognier, vice president of Microsoft 365 Consumer, wrote in the post.

Microsoft 365 Personal will now cost $9.99 per month and $99.99 per year, up from $6.99 per month and $69.99 per year. The Microsoft 365 Family plan, which serves up to six people, will cost $12.99 per month and $129.99 per year, up from $9.99 a month and $99.99 per year.

Microsoft had 84.4 million consumer subscribers to Microsoft 365 in the September quarter, up 10%. Existing customers will see the new prices upon renewal, according to the blog post.

Formerly known as Office 365, Microsoft 365 is important to the company’s efforts to compete with Google’s productivity tools in the consumer market. But sales to businesses are far more lucrative for Microsoft.

Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services represented 31% of the company’s fiscal third-quarter revenue, while Microsoft 365 consumer products and cloud services contributed less than 3%. In 2022, Microsoft increased prices of commercial Microsoft 365 subscriptions for the first time.

In addition to bringing Copilot into the Microsoft 365 applications, consumer subscribers will gain access to Microsoft Designer, an AI image editing tool.

Microsoft said that, for a limited time, existing subscribers can switch to plans without Copilot or other AI.

“These plans will continue to be maintained as they exist today, but for certain new innovations and features you’ll need a Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscription,” the company said.

24,"I would like to start out this post first by paying my respects to all those who are impacted by the devastating wildfires in LA.  By no means do I want to make the impression that i am trying to profit off of their trauma because that isnt the intent.  

However, I am still an investor and I still like see potential trends/developments.

40,000+ acres and something like 12k+ structures (as of today) have been decimated.  While they are obviously not ready for that yet, that is going to be a lot of building that will need to be done and that will be a huge demand on building materials.  Which led me to start thinking about looking into building suppliers and that this might be the right time to get in before it really explodes upward. Keep in mind that will be in addition to those impacted by recent hurricanes and the normal demand from the rest of the country.

*ConstructConnect's 2025 forecast for* ***total construction spending growth of 8.5%*** *is broad-based, with residential and nonresidential building construction expected to expand by 12% and 8%, respectively. A portion of the new year's anticipated rebound is thanks to two broad-based factors.*

I am guessing this forecast was likely done well before the devastation in LA too.  They are saying the estimated cost of recovery could be as much as 275 billion and likely to grow until the fires are contained and extinguished. I am curious what some of you think about my thoughts on this and if I am overthinking this some too (which is entirely likely).

Some of the usual suspects came to mind to support the eventual need are Home Depot, Lowes, etc etc.  However, I thought a lot of the actual builders will likely go directly to the actual suppliers (?).

So I wanted to focus my research there.  A lot of the building suppliers are not publicly traded, however, doing some quick research, I did find **BLDR**.  First a quick ""about"" BLDR:

*Builders FirstSource, Inc. is a Fortune 500 company that is a manufacturer and supplier of building materials. The company is headquartered in Irving, Texas, and is* ***the largest supplier*** *of building products, prefabricated components and value-added services in the US.*

From what I can see, their sales the last year+ are below the trend line, but I think a lot of that is because there just isnt a lot of building happening (in large part to the interest rates) and just the pure cost of building materials period.  I will let you look at their charts, sales dont look terrible, but I am more thinking about the future.  They were ahead of the trendline in 2021 and 2022 but dipped in 2023. 2024 results looks like they will be about in line with 2023 from what I can see so not much change.  

Then I thought, do I really want to have a singular focus on ONE supplier?  So I decided to take a look at ETFs and found that there are quite a few that focus specifically on building suppliers and found ITB, XHB, PKB, NAIL, HOMZ and GBLD.  I will do a screener to find more and do more comparing and research.  

However, my questions are..

Am I overthinking that now is the time to get in on this industry?

If i am NOT overthinking it, is the better play to think bigger/broader with an ETF or focus on a singular company like BLDR or a mix of both?  I am really leaning to the ETF route though. I just think that might be where the greater growth would be? 

Obviously, theres a lot of other factors that come into play (the availability of the materials, interest rates, etc) to support the need. I just feel like 

Would appreciate your thoughts/feedback.

26,"Many retail stocks have notably struggled in recent years due to numerous macroeconomic issues such as inflation and cut back on consumer spending. E-commerce giants like Amazon & Walmart continue to take market share and offer products much cheaper. A direct competitor for ASO is Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS). While Academy has struggled, Dick's has flourished with impressive growth.

For Academy, they have faced notable challenges over the past few years, including declining sales and heightened competition. However, brighter days appear to be ahead as management executes strong growth initiatives. On track to open 20 to 25 new stores in 2025, Academy plans to increase its store base by 50% in the coming years, targeting 442 to 462 locations. These efforts build on ASO’s industry-leading productivity, with $22 million in sales per store—47% higher than Dick’s Sporting Goods. By expanding beyond its Southern U.S. base, Academy has a significant runway for growth in both existing and new markets.

In addition to store expansion, ASO is leveraging private-label goods, which currently account for 21% of sales, to enhance profitability and differentiate itself in the competitive retail space. These exclusive offerings appeal to value-conscious consumers while improving margins. The company’s focus on e-commerce and omnichannel integration further strengthens its position. Despite e-commerce sales comprising only 8.8% of Q3 2025 revenue, initiatives like curbside pickup, same-day delivery, and loyalty programs are designed to drive long-term growth.

Moreover, Academy consistently delivers value to shareholders. Its $700 million share buyback program, alongside a history of increasing dividends, underscores strong free cash flow and financial discipline. Trading at a P/E ratio well below industry peers, ASO offers investors a high-quality business at an attractive valuation. With improved comparable same-store sales and a solid balance sheet, Academy is well-positioned to capitalize on its strategic initiatives, providing significant upside potential for long-term investors.

27,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat expectations, as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications continued to surge.

Here are TSMC’s fourth-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:

Net revenue: 868.46 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.36 billion), vs. NT$850.08 billion expected
Net income: NT$374.68 billion, vs. NT$366.61 billion expected

TSMC profit rose 57% from a year earlier to a record high, while revenue jumped 38.8%. The firm had forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion.

As the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC produces advanced processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple and has benefited from the megatrend in favor of AI.

TSMC’s high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove sales in the fourth quarter, contributing 53% of revenue. That HPC revenue was up 19% from the previous quarter.

“The surging demand for AI chips has exceeded expectations in Q4,” Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, adding that revenue was also bolstered by demand for the advanced chips in Apple’s latest iPhone 16 model.

The Taiwan-based company first released its December revenue last week, bringing its annual total to NT$ 2.9 trillion — a record-breaking year in sales since the company went public in 1994.


“We observed robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2024,” Wendell Huang, chief financial officer and vice president at TSMC, said in an earnings call on Thursday, adding that revenue from AI accelerator products accounted for “close to a mid-teens percentage” of total revenue in 2024.

“Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues as a key enabler of AI applications,” Huang added.

However, TSMC may face some headwinds in 2025 from U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor shipments to China and uncertainty surrounding the trade policy of President-elect Donald Trump.

TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said the company will not attend Trump’s inauguration as its philosophy is to keep a low profile, Reuters reported.

Trump, who will assume office next week, has threatened to impose broad tariffs on imports and has previously accused Taiwan of “stealing” the U.S. chip business. .

Still, Counterpoint’s Wang forecasts 2025 to be another strong year for TSMC, with significant revenue growth fueled by strong and expanding demand for AI applications, both in diversity and volume.

Taiwan-listed shares of TSMC gained 81% in 2024 and were trading 3.75% higher on Thursday.

Amazon isn’t just an e-commerce giant; it’s an ecosystem with diverse revenue streams that touch nearly every part of our lives. From its robust retail operations and cloud computing powerhouse AWS to its advertising business, device sales, and subscription services like Prime, Amazon has mastered the art of innovation and scale.

One of my favorite aspects is Amazon Prime, a service that bundles so much value into one membership. Beyond free shipping, Prime offers access to Prime Video, music streaming, exclusive deals, and more—making it a must-have for millions of households globally.

A recent highlight from Prime Video is its record-breaking performance in NFL streaming. The Steelers-Ravens playoff game brought in an impressive 22.07 million average viewers, setting a new high for Amazon’s sports streaming efforts. While this figure lags behind Netflix’s Christmas Day NFL stream and traditional broadcasters like Fox and CBS for other playoff games, it’s a significant milestone. More importantly, Amazon’s partnership with the NFL is driving Prime subscriptions and ad revenue. Their Thursday Night Football viewership grew 13% year-over-year in 2024, showcasing their ability to compete in the fiercely contested live sports space.

Looking ahead, this is just the beginning for Amazon. With its unique ability to blend commerce, media, and technology, their continued investment in live sports and other high-impact content will be transformative—not just for Prime Video but for the entire ecosystem.

I’m a college student, and I have the option to take out a loan with a super low 2.5% interest rate. I don’t actually need this loan for tuition or living expenses—I’m financially stable—but I’m considering taking it and investing the money into the S&P 500.

Here’s my thinking:
	•	Historically, the S&P 500 has averaged higher returns than 2.5%, especially over the long term.
	•	I’m looking at this as a long-term play (10+ years) and wouldn’t touch the money unless absolutely necessary.
	•	I know the stock market isn’t guaranteed, and there are risks involved, but the math seems to favor this move if I stay disciplined.

On the flip side, borrowing money to invest—even at a low interest rate—feels like it could backfire if the market underperforms or I can’t handle the payments later on.

38,"I often see people on Reddit preaching ""HOLD no matter what,"" especially when a stock is down, but does that always make sense?. If you’re holding a stock that’s down 30%, does it really matter if you recover that loss in the same stock or in another investment? At the end of the day, IT DOES NOT MATTER.

Here’s an example:  
Let’s say you’re holding Stock A, which is down 30%. To break even, it needs to go up about 43% (basic math: a 30% loss means your capital is now 70% of its original value, and 70 × 1.43 ≈ 100). Now imagine Stock B has a solid catalyst and a higher probability of delivering a 50% return in the next year. Why stick with Stock A if Stock B is the better opportunity?

The truth is, ""HOLD"" often stems from emotional biases: Loss aversion, Sunk cost fallacy and over-optimism

But here’s the kicker: The market doesn’t care where you recover your money. Whether you get back to break-even in Stock A, Stock B, or even an index fund, the result is the same. **The key is finding the best opportunity to grow your portfolio efficiently**.

Of course, there are times when ""HOLD"" is the right move: When an only you think it is still the best opportunity in terms of risk-reward

But blind loyalty to ""HOLD"" can cost you valuable time. Money isn’t static—it should always work for you in the best place possible. **The market doesn’t reward patience; it rewards good decisions**.

So before you decide to HOLD, ask yourself: Is this really the best use of my capital right now? Or am I just holding on because it feels easier than making a tough choice?

I feel like the market is sleeping on Salesforce.  All this cash being spent on GenAI/datacenters is so that these models can be utilized in a software solution that make workers more efficient.  So far it's the best way to monetize AI, and it's exactly what Salesforce is hyper-focused on.  In my mind, I don’t see how Salesforce doesn't end up dominating the Agentic AI space, and making a ton of money doing it.

##Salesforce has first dibs on the new “Digital Worker” market

There’s a general anxiety that eventually, AI will take everyone’s job.  While it’s safe to say that much of the labour force has nothing to worry about in the coming decade, there are some jobs that AI would consider low-hanging fruit:  call center staff, sales/project coordinators, customer success reps...  These types of jobs could be replaced much sooner than the rest.

The market is teetering near all-time highs waiting to see whether the AI bubble will solidify, or pop.  Many have said that AI is all hype, and that until the technology makes significant advancements, the rising valuations are unwarranted.  Many others think that the AI hype will be confirmed as real in the near future.

Salesforce, in the meantime, is accepting the challenge.  In Sept ’24 they announced Agentforce, an Agentic AI platform, which they released a month later.  In December, they announced Agentforce 2.0, which includes additional features.  It seems like they’ve got all hands on deck building and selling this new product.  Benioff (CEO) is pretty shamelessly hocking the product as well to anyone that will listen.

In my opinion, Salesforce is pivoting away from being a CRM company, to an Agentic AI company.  In the coming years, Agentforce revenue will make up a higher and higher percentage of their revenue.  As their AI advances, it stands to reason that Agentforce will even cannibalize CRM seats – for much more revenue, of course.

[Digital labour is predicted to be a $7t market in the coming years](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/generative-ai-could-raise-global-gdp-by-7-percent), and Salesforce appears to be the first-mover, on top of already having the advantage of being the biggest SaaS company in the world.  I don’t see how this plays out any other way than them taking a good chunk of the $7t market for themselves.

###Reasons I’m bullish
#####1. Massive existing customer base with an easy upsell
They are deeply entrenched with thousands customers (including 90% of the Fortune 500).  A lot of them already have Slack installed.  For some of the bigger accounts, they are already hosting training-relevant data in “Data Cloud”.  For many clients, it’s possible that deploying agents would require not much more than a bit of configuration.  Licensing model is “pay-as-you-go”, so sign-ups should be easy to get. Agentforce revenue should start hitting the books fairly soon.

#####2. New clients/segments
Salesforce can use the promise of efficient digital labour to close customers that were previously on the fence.  On top of that, they can now approach segments that had no prior interest in Salesforce at all.  (See the recently announced [Agentforce for Retail](https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/01/10/agentforce-retail-cloud-pos-announcement/))

#####3.	The Benioff Factor
You don’t have to like the guy, but Benioff is pushing Agentforce like his life depended on it.  Given his track record with Salesforce and the sheer shamelessness in his recent behaviour on social media (which I only recently started paying attention to), I can’t help but see him as a positive factor as it relates to the success of the Agentforce launch and the stock in general.

Recently Benioff has ingratiated himself to Musk over social media.  [Last month, Benioff suggested that Musk’s DOGE could use Agentic AI to reduce costs in government.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-doge-has-a-real-shot-at-cutting-costs-and-new-technologies-could-help-131314725.html)  It's possible DOGE recommends AI agents as a govt cost-cutting measure.  Salesforce is ready for that:

> ""We already have relationships with a lot of government agencies. We're already talking to them about how to bring this technology in to create more efficient agencies. And we want to continue to have even more conversations, not just with the US government, but all the governments that we have relationships within the world, really all companies. Everybody needs to embrace this technology,"" Benioff said.

#####4. All Hands On Deck
Salesforce has practically rebranded itself as an Agentic AI company in the past few months.  It has reconfigured the organization to focus almost entirely on Agentforce.  If they were simply releasing a new AI feature, then there would be a risk of, for example, Microsoft announcing a competing product, or ServiceNow being a serious contender.  But as it stands, simply due to the fact that they are not holding anything back, there will be no catching up to Agentforce.

#####5. Agentforce used internally at Salesforce
Benioff has stated that Salesforce is using Agentforce internally and that it is already significantly reducing the workload on staff.  If true, this is extremely bullish for two reasons.  Obviously, it serves as a POC for their customers, making Agentforce not only easier to sell, but quicker to deploy.  For me though, a more interesting take on this is that Benioff now needs to demonstrate a visible reduction in Salesforce operating expenses, which should increase net profit.  This would need to be shown on the next earnings call, on both reported numbers, and FY26 forecasts.

#####6. 2025 – the year of Agentic AI
AI will be the focus in 2025 as the market tries to justify the Mag 7’s furious spending on AI infrastructure.  In the past week both Jensen Huang and Satya Nadella have made statements claiming that Agentic AI is where SaaS is going.  If that is indeed the focus of 2025, and if Salesforce/Benioff continue screaming to anyone that will listen that they are 100% all in, it should create excitement around both the product, as well as the stock.  

#####7. Fundamentals

Salesforce is fairly priced at the moment, with a FP/E of 26.  Compared to other SaaS companies like ServiceNow (60) or HubSpot (77) it's an absolute bargain.  It's priced even better than Microsoft (34).  

#####8.	Future Potential (watch as I go off the deep end)
Agentforce is only the first step.  As AI develops, a more advanced version will essentially function as a fully capable employee, with access to all company data posted on Salesforce Data Cloud.  It will also have access to abstracted data across all of Salesforce, making it the most knowledgeable, experienced salesperson(?) in the world.

Is that a bit farfetched?  Maybe.  Impossible?  I don’t think so...  But what’s true, is that Salesforce is the only company with access to all that data.  I think it's likely that they will ultimately be able to pull it off.

###Bearish points + counter-arguments:

#####1.	New business model

Agentforce comes at a price tag of $2 per conversation.  I don’t think we know what that means yet, because this technology and the use-case is entirely new.  How many Agentforce conversations will an Enterprise customer use per month?  10,000?  500,000?  How many of the agent use-cases will actually perform well?  It’s going to be very hard to forecast revenue growth in the coming year, which adds uncertainty.  (Contrast this, for example, to a licensing model where users would simply have to upgrade to a license that cost an additional 30%.)

**Counter:**  While it’s hard to predict the expected revenue growth in the coming months, the positive angle is that this pricing model shows Salesforce’s extreme confidence in the product.  (Microsoft, to compare, has bundled CoPilot onto their M365 subscription service and increased pricing, without giving the customer any choice in the matter.)  It’s possible uptake will be a bit slow, I guess... but if customers do sign on (and thousands of them already have), Agentforce revenue should only go up as the offering improves and customers learn how to make better use of it.

#####2.	Everyone is using AI agents – Salesforce isn’t doing anything special

All companies are using AI agents already.  Salesforce isn’t doing anything special.  They’re just trying to pump their stock by building a product that does “AI”.

**Counter:**  Of course some companies are building AI agents, and they’ll obviously continue to do so.  But when it comes to workflow automation within Salesforce integrated solutions, all this stuff comes out of the box with Agentforce.  The customer doesn't have to build anything.  Generally, companies do not want to get involved with developing custom solutions for internal processes.

#####3.	Competition from other SaaS Companies

There are other companies in the space working on Agentic AI (ie, ServiceNow, HubSpot).  They may build a better product causing Agentforce to flop.  Salesforce is too old and decrepit to compete.

**Counter:**

* Neither of these companies come close to how entrenched/integrated Salesforce is with Enterprise customers.  It’s unrealistic to expect that their products would be so much better, to the point where a major customer chooses them over their existing Salesforce setup.

* Despite being ancient compared to some other SaaS companies, Salesforce regularly releases new major product lines.

* Competitors won’t be able to match Salesforce’s breadth across segments – particularly into Enterprise.

#####4.	Agentic AI won’t be good enough to replace workers

In the same way that nobody likes the chatbots that show up on websites to help (aka Clippy), Agentic AI will never be as good as a human at getting work done.  Over the next year, customers might decide that Agentforce doesn’t work well for them, and simply not use it that much.

**Counter:**

* Customers wouldn’t need to have the AI do everything on its own.  Some tasks would be left to humans.  There are plenty of simpler, more transactional tasks, though, that can be automated, freeing humans to spend more time on more complex ones.

* In many cases, I imagine customers would be willing to reduce service quality by 10% if it meant cost savings of 90%.

* It’s possible to argue that for some tasks, the AI would actually do a better job than the human.  (No typos, no missed messages, quicker task resolution, etc)

#####5.	Analysts forecast mediocre growth, even in 2026

Revenue growth over Salesforce’s FY2026 (which starts in April) is projected at 9%, which isn’t great.  While Agentforce might be a quality product, it would be too early to generate meaningful revenue.

**Counter:**  There is no reason to assume Agentforce should take so long to start generating meaningful revenue.

* Agentforce has a tiny sales cycle.  Enterprise customers already have it included in their licensing
* The tool is built into Salesforce.  Some agents can be set up in under an hour.
* With Agentic AI being a trend in 2025, customers should be more eager to implement it.",33,67,2025-01-15,0.9994
40,">Options traders whipsawed by the stock market’s recent gyrations are getting anxious that more bouts of volatility may arrive in the coming days, starting with Wednesday’s report on consumer prices.

>Soaring bond yields and robust jobs data have put extra focus on the next consumer price index report. The S&P 500 Index is expected to move 1% in either direction on Jan. 15, based on the cost of at-the-money puts and calls, according to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup Inc.’s head of US equity trading strategy. That’s the largest implied move ahead of a CPI print since the regional bank turmoil in March 2023.

>For a sense of what’s on the line, the reading rivals the implied move on Jan. 29 — the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest-rate decision — and is higher than the next jobs report, due on Feb. 7. Traders expect the CPI figures will offer clarity on future rate cuts this year as several big banks have changed their forecasts to fewer or later-starting reductions, with Bank of America Corp. saying they now expect none. The shift in tone has helped drive stocks lower to start the year.

>“Given the elevated volatility, a cool CPI number could quickly rally the S&P 500 back above 5,900,” said Brent Kochuba, founder of options platform SpotGamma. “We now see some large long put positions below that, so if CPI is hot then we could see the S&P 500’s rate of decline increase, which would correspond with a big VIX jump.”

>Concern about sticky inflation and the Fed’s path to contain it has pushed the Cboe Volatility Index toward 20, a level that signals concern among traders, as the S&P 500 wiped out its gains for the year. Measures of expected and realized volatility are both starting 2025 at above-average levels, according to derivatives analytical firm Asym 500.

>Overall, the rise in volatility and higher premiums for puts has made broader stock market hedging more attractive, says SpotGamma’s Kochuba. One-month realized volatility is hovering around 16, which itself justifies VIX being in the 18 to 20 range, he said.

>The reaction in options markets ahead of the CPI data demonstrates how investors are growing more sensitive to inflation reports once again. Last year, stocks had relatively muted reactions to consumer-price signals as inflation eased and focus shifted to the employment part of the Fed’s dual mandate following the most aggressive rate-tightening cycle in decades.

>The CPI report will add to the mosaic of data prints US traders will need to parse for additional clues on the Fed’s interest-rate path. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of services print on Jan. 7 — which showed a measure of prices paid for materials and services surged to the highest since early 2023 — sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index down 1.8% in its worst day since mid-December.

>Then, separate data on Friday showed the US economy added the most jobs since March in December, supporting the case for a pause in rate cuts.

>Still, investors are preparing for a cooler number at the close of 2024.

>Wednesday’s CPI report, set to be released at 8:30 a.m. in Washington, is forecast to show the core reading — which excludes food and energy costs — to have risen by 0.2% in December from a month earlier, down from 0.3% in November. That would leave the core gauge up 3.3% from a year earlier — above the Fed’s 2% target — though matching readings from the prior three months.

>If core CPI jumps more than 0.3% from the prior month, the S&P 500 will respond with a drop of as much as 2%, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Market Intelligence team led by Andrew Tyler. He sees just a 5% chance of that happening.

>In the most likely scenario laid out by the team, core CPI comes in between 0.17% and 0.23% from a month ago, and the S&P 500 gains between 0.3% and 1%, according to Tyler. A print below 0.1% may spark a rally between 1.8% to 2.5% in the S&P 500, Tyler added.

>Fourth-quarter earnings season will also officially kick off on Wednesday, led by financial bellwethers JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and BlackRock Inc., which could also contribute to outsized swings.

“Volatility is heightened into these macro events now,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.

41,"Meta is set to cut about 5% of its workforce, focusing on the company’s lowest-performing staffers, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg informed employees about the decision to “move out low performers faster” in a memo posted on the company’s internal Workplace forum on Tuesday. Zuckerberg told employees 2025 will “be an intense year.”

The company specified that it is “exiting approximately 5% of our lowest performers” in a separate message posted by a company director. The company has more than 72,000 employees, according to its most recent quarterly report.

Meta said employees affected by the cuts will be notified by Feb. 10 and receive severance in line with what the company has provided previously. The cuts represent Meta’s largest layoffs since the company eliminated 21,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its workforce, in 2022 and 2023.

Bloomberg was first to report the cuts, citing an internal memo.

The move follows several major operational changes within Meta aimed at building closer ties with President-elect Donald Trump.

Last week, Zuckerberg announced Meta would end its third-party fact-checking program in favor of a “Community Notes” model used on Elon Musk’s platform X, where individual users provide more context to posts.

“The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech, so we’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our polices and restoring free expression on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in a video announcement.

Below is Zuckeberg’s internal memo, which CNBC obtained:

""Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies of the world. AI, glasses as the next computing platform and the future of social media. This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.

I’ve decided to raise the bar on performance management and move out low performers faster. We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle, with the intention of back filling these roles in 2025. We won’t manage out everyone who didn’t meet expectations for the last period if we’re optimistic about their future performance, and for those we do let go, we’ll provide generous severance in line with what we provided with previous cuts. 

We’ll follow up with more guidance for managers ahead of calibrations. People who are impacted will be notified on February 10 or later for those outside the U.S.""

43,"Macquarie  on Tuesday agreed to take a 15% stake in Applied Digital and invest up to $5 billion in the company's artificial intelligence data centers amid booming AI demand. The 15% stake is worth roughly $250 million based on Applied Digital's closing price on Monday.

Shares of Applied Digital rose about 20% before the opening bell, as the Australian investment bank would become the company's largest shareholder according to LSEG data.

Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, providers of computing infrastructure like Applied Digital have been seeing heavy investment from companies looking to train their own AI models and get ahead of competitors. Macquarie's asset management arm has agreed to invest up to $900 million in a data center campus that Applied Digital is developing in North Dakota.

Dallas, Texas-based Applied Digital also has the right of first refusal to invest an additional $4.1 billion in future company data centers for 30 months, the company said. Applied Digital Chief Executive Wes Cummins said the deal provides the company with enough equity to construct data centers with high power demands.The new funding will be used to repay debt Applied Digital took on to build the facilities in North Dakota and will allow it to recover over $300 million of its equity investment in them, the firm said.

44," I have a small monthly savings plan reserved for BDC stocks with the aim of increasing the weighting of this area of the financial market, which is otherwise barely covered by my ETFs. I chose MAIN as my first BDC because I was particularly impressed by its NAV and EPS growth. The (monthly) dividend and the special dividend were not of major importance, but a ‘bonus’ that didn't hurt. Now MAIN did so well last year and is performing better than my 2x leveraged MSCI USA (and is only topped by BTC) which is why it pains me to let my savings plan continue and I would like to choose a second BDC to switch to in the meantime. 

While the decision in favour of MAIN was relatively easy for me, I'm having a hard time deciding on the second BDC. I currently have the following on my watchlist

- Herkules Capital, which has also performed ‘very well’ and where I have similar concerns

- Capital Southwest, which has recently struggled with sales growth and has negative EPS, and

- Ares Capital, which is also struggling with sales growth.

But none of these BDCs have completely convinced me. I have not found a UCITS ETF on BDCs either.

For this reason, I wanted to ask which BDC you would suggest to a younger investor if the focus should be more on growth and an increasing NAV. Payout yield and payout period are not important to me - but I don't mind either.

45,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

I've been a long term investor in largely mag 7s/Index funds.  
I pay attention to a few other stocks and hold them but i've come to some wealth and it's got me thinking a bit.

I dont like trading options or playing penny/meme stocks. 

I've really liked a few of the MAG 7 like $amzn & $googl and wanted to know how to play them properly.

It got me thinking about earnings. I see many people buying options/shares before earnings as a play. However, what about using earnings as a confirmation for the results. On good news, the stocks tend to run through out the day + days after i've noticed. That way, you aren't possibly risking significant amount of capital incase earnings has a bad news story wrapped into it?

E.g - $AMZN has good earnings and it runs up 4% during the day. The future growth story is there and management have lifted guidance. So wouldn't this stock be good in the next 3-6 months out considering the growth story is there. The next day after earnings will most likely also be positive as investors tend to digest the news or FOMO into longer term option plays etc.

If I wanted to take a low risk approach to playing earnings, would using earnings results + calls be the best source of confirmation for these risks?

50,">For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%.

>Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response.

>The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time.

>“It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added.

>Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007.

>“If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.”

>The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies.

>The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election.

>While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise.

>Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time.

>“Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.”

>Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds.

>The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration.

>“When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said.

>What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in.

>“The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.”

>Red Flags

>The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag.

>In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position.

>“When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.”

>One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution.

>“Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.”

>That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500.

>At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged.

>Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways.

>“The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.”

**3. ASML Holding (ASML)** \- also a fair price at the moment (Target: 1000 usd, now 739)

**4. Amgen (AMGN)** \- not really justified drop from which the company could recover (Target: 300 usd, now 260)  
**5. Applied materials (AMAT)** \-  the crystal ball was a bit more cloudy here (Target: 200 usd, now 171)

> Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thinks Apple “[hasn’t] really invented anything great in a while” and that it has been coasting off of its past success. “Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later,” he said this week. Zuckerberg made the statements during a nearly three-hour long podcast with Joe Rogan where, along with discussing Meta’s moderation policy changes and turn against diversity and inclusion policies, they got into Meta’s beef with Apple and its policies.

> The conversation actually started with Rogan’s issues with Apple. Rogan said he’s moving “from Apple to Android” in part because he doesn’t “like being attached to one company.” He also isn’t a fan of Apple’s App Store policies. “The way they do that Apple store, where they charge people 30 percent,” he said. “That seems so insane that they can get away with doing that.” “I have some opinions about this,” Zuckerberg said. While he gives credit to the iPhone as “obviously one of the most important inventions probably of all time,” he argued that Apple has put rules in place that “feel arbitrary.” Zuckerberg said that Apple has “thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way” as Apple’s own products, like the AirPods. If Apple let other people use its protocol, “there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there,” Zuckerberg said.

> Down the line, Zuckerberg envisions a world where you’ll be able to use the neural interface wristband and the glasses to text a friend or an AI and have the glasses give you the answer. He also believes that as smart glasses or even contact lenses as a computing platform become more developed, the internet will be “overlaid” on the physical world. “I think we’ll basically be in this wild world where most of the world will be physical, but there will be this increasing amount of virtual objects or people who are beaming in or hologramming into different things to interact in different ways,” he said. “There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore,” he added. “We’re in 2025. It’s one world.”",915,473,2025-01-11,0.8842

56,"I’ve been looking into NuBank (Nu) and MercadoLibre (MELI) as potential investments as I love their growth trajectories in the past, but I have some concerns. Both are as financial companies and as a commerce giant IMO heavily tied to the South American economy, and I wonder if that might pose significant risks.



Here are my thoughts:

• **Economic Instability:** Many South American countries seem financially unstable, with fluctuating GDP growth and high inflation. Are these markets reliable enough for sustained growth, or do you think this instability limits their long-term potential? Recent issues with Brazil's economy have made both stocks' price take a hit.

• **Customer Wealth:** In general, it feels like the average citizen in many of these countries doesn’t have as much purchasing power as U.S. citizens, which might limit the profitability of these companies. Is this a fair concern?

• **Currency Issues:** With some South American currencies facing devaluation over time, how much of a problem does this pose for these companies, especially in their international operations and valuation?

• **Debt Levels:** Many countries in the region have high national debt. Does this trickle down into challenges for businesses like Nu and MELI, or does their focus on consumer services and e-commerce insulate them?



For those bullish on Nu, MELI, or other South American companies, I’d love to hear your reasoning. Do you see these companies as overcoming the economic challenges of the region, or do you think the opportunity outweighs the risk?



Also, for anyone with more expertise in South American economies, I’d appreciate insights into how these dynamics compare to investing in U.S.-based companies. I understand the U.S. economy much better because it gets so much more coverage, so this is a bit outside my comfort zone.

60,"Apple is losing market share in China due to declining iPhone shipments, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a report on Friday. The stock slid 2.4%.

“Apple has adopted a cautious stance when discussing 2025 iPhone production plans with key suppliers,” Kuo, an analyst at TF Securities, wrote in the post. He added that despite the expected launch of the new iPhone SE 4, shipments are expected to decline 6% year over year for the first half of 2025.

Kuo expects Apple’s market share to continue to slide, as two of the coming iPhones are so thin that they likely will only support eSIM, which the Chinese market currently does not promote.

“These two models could face shipping momentum challenges unless their design is modified,” he wrote.

Kuo wrote that in December, overall smartphone shipments in China were flat from a year earlier, but iPhone shipments dropped 10% to 12%.

There is also “no evidence” that Apple Intelligence, the company’s on-device artificial intelligence offering, is driving hardware upgrades or services revenue, according to Kuo. He wrote that the feature “has not boosted iPhone replacement demand,” according to a supply chain survey he conducted, and added that in his view, the feature’s appeal “has significantly declined compared to cloud-based AI services, which have advanced rapidly in subsequent months.”

Apple’s estimated iPhone shipments total about 220 million units for 2024 and between about 220 million and 225 million for this year, Kuo wrote. That is “below the market consensus of 240 million or more,” he wrote.

61,"I've recently conducted an in-depth analysis of North American Construction Group Ltd. (NOA), a prominent player in the heavy equipment and mining services sector. Here are some key takeaways:

Investment Highlights:

* Strong Financial Growth: NOA has achieved a revenue CAGR of 15.5% from 2019 to 2023, with projections reaching $1.5 billion by 2025.
* Strategic Diversification: The acquisition of MacKellar Group has expanded NOA's operations into Australia, diversifying revenue across more than 30 resource types and enhancing year-round fleet utilization.
* Compelling Valuation: Currently trading at a 7.2x NTM P/E, NOA is undervalued compared to peers, suggesting a potential 32% upside with a P/E expansion to 9.5x (excluding any growth).
* Operational Excellence: With a ROIC of 12.5% in 2023 and cost savings of 30-50% through in-house equipment maintenance, NOA demonstrates strong operational efficiency.
* Shareholder Alignment: Insider ownership stands at 11.4%, indicating management's commitment to shareholder interests, complemented by disciplined capital allocation and minimal share dilution.
* Robust Backlog: A $3.6 billion backlog provides approximately 2.4x annual revenue coverage, offering strong visibility into future earnings.

Key Considerations:

* Cyclicality: As with many in the mining and construction sectors, NOA's performance is subject to commodity price fluctuations and economic cycles.
* Capital Intensity: The industry requires substantial ongoing investment in equipment maintenance and fleet replacement.
* Customer Concentration: A significant portion of revenue is derived from a few large clients, which could pose risks if any relationships change.

I see this mistake on here constantly, especially in recent years as more casual investors have entered into the stock market. When it comes to indexes, celebrate the dip and buy, absolutely.

*It's a guaranteed recovery as long as a world war doesn't break out and destroy America (we Canadians are ready to check off more of the Geneva checklist if you Yanks try anything funny).* /s 

But for individual stocks? No. The story is different. AI may or may not be a bubble, but it's objectively true that some companies have profited greatly off of their AI investments while others have only made performative moves and have yet to see any real profit.

Quantum computing is another hot area worth mentioning. So many people are tempted to chase what is an obvious bubble. As Jensen Huang said, we aren't even close. It's just gambling at this point, even if a 40% dip makes you feel like you have a ""margin of safety."" 

People have gotten used to infinite V movements. There was a guy in the daily thread for months pointing out how every dip was immediately bought back up. This is not always the case, as we're seeing now. There's no guarantee that a stock will return to ATHs, even if it's one of our beloved bluechips. 

But just because something is now lower in price does not make it ""on sale."" If a banana used to be $100 and is now $50, would you buy it? No! That's still an outrageous price. Find some 10 cent kiwis instead. 

Obligatory AMD comment: yes it was $200. No that price likely wasn't justified. I can't say whether the current price is good or bad, but with a narrow moat and poor performance in a historical semi/data centre run, it's been disappointing. It could absolutely skyrocket again, but that is not promised to you. For many, it is only now approaching a fair value, and for others it needs to dip below 100 or even less to reach that point. Despite being almost 50% from its ATH, it may still just be a $50 banana!

65,"So, after Travis Kalanick got ousted, Dara Khosrowshahi stepped in and turned Uber from a “wartime” to a “peacetime” company. He cleaned up the culture mess, shoved aside long-term moonshots (like Uber’s self-driving unit) and put the company on a strict path to profitability (as expected from a former Wall Street banker).

Despite getting smacked by COVID and high interest rates, Uber tightened its belt, doubled down on demand-supply matchmaking, and came out profitable. Wall Street went nuts. Uber is now FCF-positive and aiming for even higher margins. 

**So what is Uber today?**

Dara says they’re laser-focused on nailing that perfect supply-demand match. Sure, they’re winning in mobility and they might tackle new verticals like Fiverr-style marketplaces. Sounds great, except they’re missing out on the biggest opportunity of our era, which is motherfucking **AI.**

Uber collects **11B trips** a year from **160M users**, racking up insane amounts of data (driver reviews, food reviews, social patterns across countless cities etc). This could’ve made them a self-driving powerhouse. But they ditched their autonomous unit in 2020 to cut costs, just as NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang now shows off new automotive processors and partnerships with Toyota, Aurora (who bought Uber’s AV unit), and Volvo. **Uber’s name is nowhere on that list!!!**

No matter how you spin it, a simple “supply-demand” marketplace could get overshadowed once autonomous vehicles go mainstream. Especially when you already own the infrastructure for ride-hailing, food delivery, scooters and bikes.

**Investors might be licking their chops (at least I would do it If I were them)** at two big plays:

1. **Pull a Reddit:** Sell anonymized data for LLM training and get lots of money, further increasing margins. Instantly, Uber gets an “AI play.” 
2. **Sell to Tesla or Google:** Supercharge someone else’s AV ambitions (as well as their foundation models) and get a fat premium in the process.

Meanwhile, the stock still looks undervalued. Uber’s **LTM P/FCF** is around **22.6x**, PEG is **under 1.0x** (Peter Lynch territory), and a Reverse DCF suggests they only need **9.2% revenue growth** (at \~12.4% margins) over 10 years to justify the current price. That’s totally doable.

Here’s how I see it playing out:

1. **Best case:** Tesla or Google acquires them this year and we get a solid premium payday. Probably a stock deal, but it’s still peanuts compared to Tesla and Google market caps. 
2. **Second best:** Uber pivots to selling AI training data. 
3. **Not bad either:** Uber dominates more human-driven marketplaces. 
4. **Base scenario:** They stick to mobility, keep expanding margins, and *maybe* bolt on third-party AVs .

Goldman Sachs recently issued a warning that U.S. equities are looking increasingly vulnerable to a significant correction. In their latest analysis, they estimate a 30% probability of a large drop in stock prices. The primary concern? Stocks are currently “priced for perfection,” meaning that even small disappointments in economic growth, earnings, or monetary policy could trigger a sell-off.

Their argument is built on a few key points:
	1.	Valuation Risks: Major indices, like the S&P 500, are trading at elevated multiples. Investors seem to be betting on a Goldilocks scenario where inflation falls, the economy avoids a recession, and corporate profits remain robust. But is this realistic?
	2.	Economic Uncertainty: The Federal Reserve is walking a tightrope, and even a slight misstep could spook markets. While inflation is easing, the labor market remains tight, and wage growth could reignite inflationary fears.
	3.	Earnings Pressure: Many companies have beaten earnings expectations lately, but the bar was set low. Will this trend hold as consumer spending slows and borrowing costs rise?

What This Means for Investors:

Goldman isn’t calling for an imminent crash, but their warning should make us question the current level of complacency. Are we ignoring the risks of tighter monetary policy or a slowing economy?

For those holding cash or considering hedges, this could be a good moment to reassess your strategy. At the same time, long-term investors may see any correction as an opportunity to buy quality companies at more reasonable prices.

>The bulk of Amazon’s ad revenue comes from sponsored product advertisements, which are keyword-targeted ads that let brands promote certain items. Amazon has stuffed more of these sponsored items into search results and product pages over time. It also generates some ad revenue through streaming.

>With Amazon Retail Ad Service, users will be able to customize the design, placement and number of ads shown across their sites, as well as use Amazon’s ad measurement and reporting tools.

>The service could provide Amazon with valuable data it can use to bolster its ad prediction and recommendation technology. The company said early customers include health and wellness retailer iHerb, Asian grocery startup Weee! and Oriental Trading Co., which sells toys, party and craft supplies.

“At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email to CNBC on Wednesday. “We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.”

Business Insider reported on the plans late Tuesday.

The job cuts will affect less than 1% of employees, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.

Microsoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June. While the company’s net income margin of nearly 38% is close to its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft’s stock underperformed its peers last year, rising 12% while the Nasdaq gained 29%.

Microsoft’s latest cuts are slim compared to recent downsizing efforts.

In early 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees and consolidated leases. In January 2024, three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap.

As 2025 begins, Microsoft faces a more tenuous relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which the company has backed to the tune of over $13 billion. The partnership helped propel Microsoft’s market cap past $3 trillion last year.

Over the summer, Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the phrase “cooperation tension” while discussing the relationship with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on a podcast released last month.

Meanwhile, the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which draws on OpenAI technology, has yet to become pervasive in business. Analysts at UBS said in a note last month that they came away from Microsoft’s Ignite conference with the impression that Copilot rollouts “have been a bit slow/underwhelming.”

Microsoft is still touting its growth opportunities. Finance chief Amy Hood said in October that revenue growth from Microsoft’s Azure cloud will speed up in the first half of this year because of greater AI infrastructure capacity.

Tech giants are throwing billions into AI datacenters, these centers require a LOT of energy.  
Current administration restricted fossil fuels in order to reduce carbon emissions.  New administration plans to remove restrictions.

Large companies are throwing around insane numbers to invest in AI datacenters (Microsoft plans to spend $80B in 2025, Amazon spent $11B and every other tech giant has shown or already enacted similar plans).

Biden administration heavily regulated and restricted fossil fuels and provided grants to nuclear energy companies.  

The incoming Trump administration has been clear that they plan to overturn these restrictions and return to fossil fuels.  Multiple major U.S oil and gas suppliers such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil announced in December that they plan to pivot and provide power to AI datacenters.

I am not confident about my ability to predict the next major AI company but I am confident that these centers will need power, and a lot of it.  

Location will be incredibly important as suppliers closest to the centers will have the advantage.  Existing American oil/gas suppliers that extend across the U.S and can meet increased demand seem to be ideal qualities.",0,40,2025-01-08,0.9016

Two Israeli companies, Teva Pharmaceuticals and Wix.com, have been selected as top picks for 2025 by leading US analysts.

Bank of America included Teva in its biopharma survey, highlighting the company’s strong performance and potential for continued growth. Teva, which is led by CEO Richard Francis, saw its stock rise by 111% in 2024 and now has a market cap of $24.6 billion. Bank of America raised its price target for Teva shares from $25 to $26, citing positive financial results, plans to sell its active ingredients division, and significant debt reduction efforts. Additionally, the success of duvakitug, a drug for inflammatory bowel disease co-developed with Sanofi, boosted investor confidence after strong Phase 2 trial results. Analysts believe Teva's strong product pipeline and turnaround strategy leave room for further price increases.

In the Internet sector, Cantor Fitzgerald selected Wix.com as a top pick alongside major players like Meta, Amazon, and DoorDash. Wix, under the leadership of CEO Avishai Abrahami, saw its stock rise by 74% in 2024, bringing its market cap to $12.1 billion. Cantor Fitzgerald raised its price target for Wix shares from $240 to $260, emphasizing the company's robust roadmap, pricing strength, and new AI product launches. Analysts believe these factors will drive growth and expand Wix’s trading multiples. Furthermore, Wix is seen as a potential acquisition target, adding to its attractiveness for investors. 

Both companies have demonstrated significant momentum and are positioned for further success in 2025, driven by innovation and strategic initiatives.",0,0,2025-01-08,0.9948

Hello, fellow investors. Long story short, Pinduoduo (PDD) looks like a great investment. And before you start furiously typing CHINA like ----(Rule #5 – censored)----, hear me out on this one. I’ve broken down my DD into 5 blocks:

1. **The business**
2. **Competitive Advantages**
3. **Insider Alignment**
4. **Risks**
5. **Valuation**

(TL;DR at the end).

To give you a taste of the kind behaviour we’re talking about, check out how Chinese e-commerce performed during Trump's last stint.

\----(Rule #2 – img censored)----

**1. The business**

Pinduoduo is a Chinese e-commerce giant, with low debt and high consolidated earnings, that offers the best deals by grouping individuals to scale orders offering large discounts to buyers. They have a complex business architecture with their main listing and ownership being established in Hong Kong. They are also settled in Ireland (Europe), Singapore and offshore islands.

[PDD corporate mangle](https://ibb.co/xH4HCdY) 

In mainland China, they are very focused on rural areas, where other peers don´t have a strong presence, offering a wide range of products from fresh produce to electronics. Globally, the company has expanded through its cross-border platform, Temu ([Temu life hack](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1g4kqfl/ulpt_find_something_on_temu_but_want_it_the_next/)), targeting value-conscious international shoppers with affordable goods. Temu has been unprofitable in recent years due to significant investments aimed at establishing its presence in the international market. However, this strategy is now on the verge of paying off, as 2024 is projected to be the first year the business turns a profit, which would print huge headlines and a big sentiment shift.

Their mainland customers are primarily farmers and factory owners, who benefit from the platform by purchasing large quantities of essential products for their businesses. They can then sell their finished goods on Temu, reaching international customers in markets like the U.S. This interconnected ecosystem supports small businesses and fosters customer loyalty by creating a mutually beneficial cycle of trade that reinforces trust and long-term engagement with the Pinduoduo brand.

They are profitable and have been for many years, with only 46% of revenue coming from mainland China in 2023, down from 60% in 2021, which shows the rapid expansion of their international business.

**2. Competitive advantages**

In a slowing global economy, with high financial stress on families, affordable products are going to see increased demand, not only in the U.S. but also in Europe. PDD's ability to buy 1st hand from producers in rural (and cheap) areas of China allows them to have a price advantage over all other competitors, and at worst equal them.

[TEMU (Non-PRC) and mainland China (PRC) EBIT during the last years](https://ibb.co/nCb3Yzm) 

Pinduoduo's focus on rural areas and low-tier cities in China gives it a significant competitive advantage, as these regions are characterized by low competition and minimal pressure on margins. Major players like Alibaba and JD are not heavily focused on these areas, and attempting to penetrate them would likely be unprofitable in the long term due to Pinduoduo's first-mover advantage. The company has already consolidated relationships with many of the small suppliers in these regions, creating a robust and profitable business model with strong cash flows. These cash flows not only sustain operations but also fuel Pinduoduo’s international expansion efforts. Furthermore, this strategy aligns with the Chinese government's emphasis on reducing economic disparity between the wealthier coastal provinces and poorer inland regions. By driving economic activity and wealth creation in underserved areas, Pinduoduo is less likely to face regulatory scrutiny, making its business model both financially and politically resilient.

**3. Investor alignment**

PDD’s founder and ex-CEO, Colin Huang, is the largest single shareholder, holding around 24% of the company. He’s a computer science genius educated in the U.S. and a former Google engineer.

Although personal retributions for current board members are opaque, from their statements we can see that their main form of retribution are stock options. They received last year 2.3 million $ cash vs nearly 400 million $ in stock options (at today´s market price) dating up to 2043, nearly 29 years into the future.

[Compensation table of current board](https://ibb.co/GdDrtSb)

If 95.5% of my salary was tied to the stock performance, I think we could be sure my interest is aligned with that of a shareholder. Although the opacity of the information might raise suspicious looks, the overall picture shows a correct alignment of their interests with ours.

**4. Risks**

Let´s address the elegant elephant in the room:CHINA

----(Rule #5 – img censored)----

Let me guess—a totalitarian state ruled by an almighty communist party deciding which companies to meddle with isn’t exactly your idea of a safe investment. Same here. But more importantly, it’s not the preference of Chinese business owners either. That’s why they’ve taken extensive measures to protect their interests. Pinduoduo is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has its headquarters in Ireland, and its founder has stepped down from management to reduce political exposure. Their accounts are audited by EY, and their complex ownership structure ensures that different parts of the business operate under separate jurisdictions, adding an extra layer of security.

All of this sounds great, but let’s be real—if *the party ----(Rule #5 – censored)----* decides they want Pinduoduo gone, they’re gone. So, the real question we need to ask is: do they, or will they, want them gone? My honest answer is no. As mentioned earlier, Pinduoduo is a key player in China’s agricultural supply chain, particularly in the poorer, rural regions. This matters because the CCP has a history of cracking down on ultra-rich elites flaunting their wealth as part of their push to address inequality and maintain social stability. In contrast, Pinduoduo plays a critical role in supporting these underdeveloped areas by providing affordable goods and access to global markets. A company that drives economic activity and stability in low-income regions is more of an asset than a threat to the government’s goals.

On top of that, PDD is still a relatively small player in China, holding a solid 14% of the market despite its impressive growth in recent years. This means any concerns about monopoly risks are far off the table. If anything, it’s their bigger competitors - like Alibaba - who are more likely to face anti-monopoly action. Such regulatory pressure on rivals could open up even more opportunities for PDD to expand and solidify its position in its most profitable market.

**5. Valuation**

Before getting into the numbers, let´s explain the 3 base scenarios proposed.

1. **Bear Scenario**: A major political or economic downturn disrupts the business. For instance, tariffs ----(Rule #5 – censored)----could nullify international expansion/profitability, or the CCP might suddenly decide e-commerce is undesirable. In this case, we assume 0% top-line growth, even though such events would likely only impact around 50% of revenue. This ultra-conservative assumption gives this scenario a 30% probability, though some have claimed it’s been ""100% certain"" for the past decade (and yet here we are).
2. **Neutral Scenario**: Growth slows, no significant market share is gained, margins compress, and valuation ratios stay at current all-time lows. Under this scenario, growth matches the pace of the Chinese e-commerce market, as predicted by analysts.
3. **Bullish Scenario**: Growth remains robust, though slightly below recent levels for conservatism. E-commerce in China expands as forecasted, and PDD continues to capture market share from competitors. We assign this scenario a 20% probability.

As you are all great investors, I won't bore you in excess going through every single number. Here’s a quick summary of the key metrics:

* Bear case: 0% growth, margin EBIT 23%, PER = 9, P/FCF = 7
* Medium case: 15% growth, margin EBIT 26%, PER = 11, P/FCF = 12
* Bull case: 20% growth, margin EBIT 30%, PER = 20, P/FCF = 15

*\~Al ratios are picked from historic PDD data during bull and bear markets\~*

Now let's get straight into the valuations:

[Valuations](https://ibb.co/9NnK3SJ)

From the model, it’s clear we’re looking at a solid deal here: about a **30% margin of safety** and the potential to **double our money in 5 years** (CAGR \~16%). On top of that, this investment serves as a hedge against any potential U.S. economic crisis.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR:** PDD is a high-growth e-commerce play with strong competitive advantages in Chinese markets and a solid international expansion strategy through Temu. With the lowest political risks among its peers and an undervalued price, it offers a \~30% margin of safety and the potential to double in 5 years (CAGR \~16%). ",1,32,2025-01-08,0.9992

# Welcome to the face-meltingly fast world of M&A trading.

**News:** At 3:16 ET on 1/06/2025, NARI spiked to the upper ($47.25 -> $52.66) on news that Stryker (SYK) was reportedly in the final stages of negotiations to acquire Inari Medical, a company that produces devices for the treatment of venous diseases. This was posted on Monday by Reuters.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**There's a decent amount to unpack here:**

\- Strong reaction to news with an immediate move to upper for NARI, but no real reaction in SYK.  
\- ""Final stages of negotiations to acquire Inari Medical"". Note that it says final stages- this isn't random speculation that moves a stock 1 or 2 percent, this is actual news that an acquisition bid is happening.  
\- Reuters is a reputable news source (compared to hearing this from some rando on Twitter), they wouldn't post this unless there was high confirmation.  
\- Medical device acquisitions typically don't have high chance of being broken up by the FTC- last one I vaguely remember was Boston Scientific (BSX) back in 2022 acquiring some South Korean company being broken up.

Both companies involved are fairly large, NARI had a roughly $3B market cap before this news broke. It takes a lot of money to meaningfully move the price for a company this large. SYK didn't move.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**While the stock is halted, it becomes a game of:**

\- ""What price will NARI unhalt at?"" and  
\- ""What is likely to be the acquisition price for NARI?""

**From here, you can intuit some measure of EV (expected value) if know the right questions to ask:**

\- Is there meaningful value in shorting SYK (because it hasn't moved) if the rumors are true?  
\- Is that EV from shorting SYK better than buying NARI?  
\- What is the EV of buying NARI? We're already up 10%!

**When you see a stock move like this, how much more will it move?**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Speed Trade:

**Executing:** Realistically, two places to make the ""speed"" trade- initial ""rumor"" news release (3:16 ET), and the actual announcement of the deal (4:08 ET)

**Infra:** I'm assuming that this broke on Reuters Eikon (which is their equivalent to Bloomberg Terminal), but likely that Bloomberg users were able to capture this as well.

**EV:** Best EV since you'll get it close to flat and can bail on the trade if we reach pre-news prices again. In theory, your EV is 0 in the worst case scenario and ludicrously best in the best case.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Unhalt Trade (The EV Trade):

**Executing:** You would be able to look at the unhalt price (which is what the stock will open at) and determine whether or not you're still willing to be a buyer at \~$58. At unhalt, that's roughly 22% premium in acquisition, and remember that these are still *rumors (despite being in final stages).*

**Thought Process:** Ultimately, you'd have a price point in your mind that you think the market would value this stock at. You also determine the probability the market thinks the deal will go through, then multiply that to get a *very rough guess* of what the stock will trade at. Personally, I didn't know this, but ChatGPT cited 20-40% premium on acquisition purchases of medical device companies. So we have a theoretical range of $57-$66.50 (reduced by multiplying whatever percentage of success you think the deal will go through).

The market was pricing something FAR above that 20%- within the next 10 minutes we go up to $63, then trade around a range of $61 to $65, so fairly within expectations despite all the uncertainty. Ultimately the best case scenario for this type of trade is buying at unhalt (\~$58 and selling within $61-$65).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The End.... or is it?

Overall, that would've been the extent of what most traders- but after the market closed, [SYK announced that they were actually going to acquire NARI for $80/share in cash at 4:08 PM. ](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/06/3004972/0/en/Stryker-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-Inari-Medical-Inc-providing-entry-into-high-growth-peripheral-vascular-segment.html)That blows all the ""theoretical"" range in the EV trade out of the water- we have a ***hard defined*** EV we can base our trades around- and the **speed trade is back on. So the stock spiked from $65.84 to $83, then settles at $78.**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Arbitrage Trade (likely just old offers and sloppy executions):

Notice how I said that the stock spiked to $83 despite the deal price being $80? That's a classic example of a market inefficiency.

Remember that this news was released at 4:08 PM, so it's afterhours- liquidity is far more sparse and market making algos are not as active because there are less participants.

Some traders were probably too slow to getting their buy orders in upon seeing the news or they blasted the offer without looking at remaining liquidity, so they bought at prices ABOVE $80, what SYK was willing to pay.

If you were a superhuman trader you'd be able to short at prices above $80, but it was more likely that these were old offers that weren't adjusted by human traders or market makers, and got extremely lucky.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The M&A Trade:

**Executing/Thought Process:** Not much to speak of here, we went to roughly $78 after SYK formally announced they were acquiring, so there's less than a 2.5% potential gain in an unknown timeframe. Overall not worth it. You COULD short some SYK after the deal announcement (a 68% acquisition premium may be viewed negatively by the market).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Takeaways:

* **If a stock reacts this quickly to a rumor, likely that the company will release follow-up news to dispel or confirm it shortly after.** If you were able to get the speed trade or even good prints on the EV trade, it was worth keeping *a little* if you were wary of holding your entire position. This was made more difficult because the rumor was formally confirmed afterhours, so most people likely would have pared a significant amount of their position.
* **Extremely important to keep a ""Expected Value"" of the trade in your head in times of ambiguity**. If you had a decent mental framework of how these M&A deals worked (and could reference the premium of medical device companies), it could have influenced your trading coming out of the unhalt.
* The best EV is speed. (self-explanatory)
